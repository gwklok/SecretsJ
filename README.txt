SecretsJ was written to provide a portable encrypted password storage system
around the turn of the millennia (fun to say that).  The name lacks in the
originality department, I wrote a similar command line utility in C++ prior to
this, but the hassle of autoconf, and C++ quirks at the time made it much less
portable then it needed to be.

"ant" should build and start SecretsJ

It is released purely for the sake of releasing it, there are less buggy better
featured alternatives available, you should use those! I am not sure about the
portability aspect I am sure something else like this exists, it would be swell
if there was a command line portable utility to handle the OS X key-chain, maybe
thats a project for a later day.
